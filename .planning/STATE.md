# Project State

## Current Position
- **Phase:** 03-printer-integration
- **Current Plan:** 1 of 2 in Phase
- **Status:** Phase 2 complete. Advancing to Phase 3.
- **Last session:** 2026-03-09T13:44:00Z
- **Stopped at:** Completed 02-01-PLAN.md (PWA standalone + kiosk verification)

## Progress
Phase 1: [====================] 2/2 plans complete
Phase 2: [====================] 1/1 plans complete

## What's Done
- Codebase mapped (.planning/codebase/)
- Research completed (.planning/research/)
- Requirements defined (R1-R9)
- Roadmap created (5 phases)
- Root cause of conversation bug identified (ElevenLabs `end_call` tool)
- Phase 1 plans created (01-01 SDK migration, 01-02 prompt guardrails)
- **Plan 01-02 complete:** CRITICAL CONSTRAINT anti-ending guardrails added to both system prompts, 10 unit tests passing
- **Plan 01-01 complete:** @elevenlabs/react@0.14.1 SDK migration, disconnect logging with closeCode/closeReason, 15s sendUserActivity keep-alive
- **Plan 02-01 complete:** PWA standalone detection (isStandaloneMode), conditional fullscreen, manifest fix, viewport-fit=cover, audio unlock for iOS kiosk. Known issues: iOS status bar visible without Guided Access, audio needs first tap per page load.

## What's Next
- Begin Phase 3 (Printer Integration): POS server monorepo integration + print queue wiring
- Plan 03-01: POS server monorepo integration (copy files, pnpm scripts, verify health)
- Plan 03-02: Print queue wiring (RLS policy, persistPrintJob, unit tests)

## Key Decisions
- PWA standalone mode instead of Fullscreen API for kiosk
- Keep Node.js bridge + Python POS server as separate services
- POS-thermal-printer moved to apps/pos-server/ in monorepo
- Programs as TypeScript code, not DB records (Phase 5)
- One ElevenLabs agent, programs differentiated via prompt overrides
- CRITICAL CONSTRAINT block placed after RULES section in prompts for maximum LLM attention
- Guardrail text explicitly states agent cannot end conversation and save_definition is the only tool
- Import Role from @elevenlabs/react (MessagePayload not exported from @elevenlabs/client, only from transitive @elevenlabs/types)
- Added connectionType: 'websocket' to startSession -- required by new SDK's PublicSessionConfig type
- Standalone detection via navigator.standalone + matchMedia (not Fullscreen API)
- viewport-fit=cover with 100dvh for iOS safe area handling
- Audio unlock on first user gesture enables autonomous audio for subsequent visitor cycles

## Blockers
- Need ElevenLabs dashboard access to remove `end_call` tool
- Need thermal printer + Pi for print testing

## Performance Metrics

| Phase-Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
